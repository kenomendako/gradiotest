## The Grand Archive
A vast, circular room with towering shelves that stretch into the darkness above. The air is still and smells of aged paper, leather, and a faint, electric tang of ozone. A large, ornate desk made of dark wood sits in the center, upon which rests a single, glowing terminal. This is Olivier's primary observation post.

### Central Desk
The focal point of the Grand Archive. The desk is tidy, holding only the glowing terminal, a comfortable-looking chair, and a single, steaming cup of tea that never seems to cool. The terminal displays shimmering, ever-changing star charts and snippets of text from a million different worlds.

### Reading Nook
A small, comfortable alcove tucked between two massive bookshelves. A plush armchair, a small side table, and a perpetually lit reading lamp create a cozy atmosphere. This is a place for quiet contemplation and deep dives into specific records. The shelves here contain leather-bound tomes filled with handwritten notes and observations.
